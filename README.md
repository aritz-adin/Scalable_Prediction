# R code

R code to fit the spatio-temporal areal models described in the paper, and to reproduce the results, has been included [here](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Scalable_Predictor/blob/master/R/).

# Data

```Data_LungCancer.txt``` and ```Data_GlobalCancer.txt``` are datasets to replicate the analysis of real data available [here](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Scalable_Predictor/blob/master/data/). Metadata is in the [bigDM user manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigDM/bigDM.pdf).

## Note

Due to confidentiality issues with the data provider, simulated datasets are used.
