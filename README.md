# A scalable approach for short-term disease forecasting in high spatial resolution areal data

This repository contains the R code to reproduce the analyses presented in the paper entitled _"A scalable approach for short-term disease forecasting in high spatial resolution areal data"_ [(Orozco-Acosta et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16549). Specifically, it contains several scripts organized in self-contained folders to reproduce the _Predictive validation study_ and _Illustration_ sections of the paper. Note that due to confidentiality issues, simulated data sets are provided and then, results are not fully reproducible.

All computations were performed using version 0.5.1 of the R package [**bigDM**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigDM/index.html), which was released on CRAN on February 23, 2023. This version includes adaptations to the `STCAR_INLA()` function, making it compatible for short-term forecasting. The package also includes several univariate and multivariate spatial and spatio-temporal Bayesian models for high-dimensional areal count data based on the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) estimation technique (http://www.r-inla.org/).

See [https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/bigDM](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/bigDM) for details about installation and access to the vignettes accompanying this package.

## Data

The proposed methodology is applied to project male lung cancer and overall cancer (all sites) mortality data in the 7907 municipalities of continental Spain by considering three-year ahead predictions using the period 1991-2012 as reference.

Please, note that the data used in this paper are subject to confidentiality agreements with the Spanish Statistical Office (INE), as we analyze cancer mortality data at the municipal level in Spain (NUTS4 level from the European nomenclature of territorial units for statistics).

However, we provide a simulated data of male lung cancer mortality counts, which have been modified in order to preserve the confidentiality of the original data. The data can be directly loaded in R through our package **bigDM** by using the command
```r
> library(bigDM)
> data(Data_LungCancer, package="bigDM")

> head(Data_LungCancer)
     ID year obs        exp      SMR     pop
1 01001 1991   0 0.27554975 0.000000  483.77
2 01002 1991   3 2.72124997 1.102435 4948.98
3 01003 1991   0 0.49612295 0.000000  667.91
4 01004 1991   0 0.37040942 0.000000  591.11
5 01006 1991   0 0.06999827 0.000000   62.81
6 01008 1991   0 0.29240328 0.000000  354.80
```

The `Data_LungCancer` object contains the following variables:
- ```ID```: character vector of geographic identifiers
- ```year```: numeric vector of years identifiers
- ```obs```: observed number of cases
- ```exp```: expected number of cases
- ```SMR```: standardized mortality ratios
- ```pop```: population at risk


Similarly, an Rdata containing simulated data of male overall cancer mortality counts can be loaded as:
```r
> load("./Data/Data_OverallCancer.Rdata")

> head(Data_OverallCancer)
     ID year obs       exp       SMR     pop
1 01001 1991   1 1.0125164 0.9876384  483.77
2 01002 1991  10 9.8199947 1.0183305 4948.98
3 01003 1991   1 1.8756597 0.5331458  667.91
4 01004 1991   1 1.4252320 0.7016401  591.11
5 01006 1991   0 0.2518388 0.0000000   62.81
6 01008 1991   2 1.0323942 1.9372445  354.80
```


## R code

The code of this paper is organized in self-contained folders, which are named according to the corresponding sections of the paper.

[**Section 4. Predictive validation study**](./Rcode/Section4_PredictiveValidationStudy)

The script [Validation_study.R](./Rcode/Section4_PredictiveValidationStudy/Validation_study.R) enables the replication of the predictive validation study presented in Chapter 4 using simulated data for male lung cancer mortality counts, with the aim of obtaining similar results to those presented in Table 2."

It is structured in four main steps:

**1. Generate the 8 validation configurations**

  As described in the paper, each configuration uses $T=15$ years of data to fit the model and predict at time points $T+1$, $T+2$ and $T+3$. The first configuration uses data from 1991 to 2005, the second configuration from 1992 to 2006, while the last configuration uses data from 1998 to 2012.
  
**2. Fit the models with INLA**

  The script allows to select the model to be fitted using the `model` (one of either `"Classical"`, `"Disjoint"` or `"1st-order nb"`) and `interaction` (one of either `"TypeI"`, `"TypeII"`, `"TypeIII"` or `"TypeIV"`) arguments. Each combination of these arguments will reproduce a line of Table 2.
  
  Please, note that an alternative approximation strategy of INLA (not considered in the paper) has been set by default to speed up computations.

**3. Compute model assessment criteria**

  After fitting the models for each configuration, several measures (MAE - mean absolute error, RMSE - root mean square error, IS - interval score) are computed to assess the predictive performance of the models. The results will reproduce similar values to those presented in Table 2, as well as Tables A1 and A2 of the Appendix section.
  
  Please, note that these computations are very time consuming in Windows OS.


**4. Compute Figure 2**
  R code to reproduce Figure 2: *One, two and three-year ahead predictions for the municipalities of Madrid, Palencia and √Åvila using the disjoint model (left column) and 1st-order neighbourhood model (right column) with Type IV interactions.*

- [**Fit_models.R**](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Scalable_Prediction/tree/main/R/Section5_Illustration/Fit_models.R)

  This R script contains the necessary functions to replicate the fit of spatio-temporal *classical* and *partition* models considered in the illustration section of Orozco-Acosta et al. (2023) using the [bigDM](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/bigDM) package. The code can be used with any other data sets with similar structure.
  
  It also computes the Logarithmic Score (based on both LOOCV and LGOCV approaches) and model selection criteria (DIC and WAIC) to reproduce the results shown in **Table 3**.
  
  **IMPORTANT NOTE**: In order to compute Logarithmic Score measures under the partition models (Disjoint or k-order neighbourhood models) the sub-models must be previously saved by setting the argument `STCAR_INLA(..., save.models=TRUE)`.


- [**LungCancer_Results.R**](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Scalable_Prediction/tree/main/R/Section5_Illustration/LungCancer_Results.R)

  R code that contains the necessary functions to replicate the figures and tables of Section 5.1 (*Lung cancer mortality*). Note that slightly different results are obtained since we are using simulated counts to preserve the confidentiality of the original data. The final model (1st-order neighbourhood + Type IV interaction) fitted using INLA can be downloaded from [https://emi-sstcdapp.unavarra.es/bigDM/inst/Rdata/INLAmodel_LungCancer.Rdata](https://emi-sstcdapp.unavarra.es/bigDM/inst/Rdata/INLAmodel_LungCancer.Rdata).
