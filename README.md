# A scalable approach for short-term forecasting in high spatial resolution areal data

This repository contains the R code to fit the models described in the paper entitled _"A scalable approach for short-term forecasting in high spatial resolution areal data"_ [(Orozco-Acosta et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16549).

All computations were performed using version 0.5.1 of the R package [**bigDM**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigDM/index.html), which was released on CRAN on February 23, 2023. This version includes adaptations to the `STCAR_INLA()`  function, making it compatible for short-term forecasting.
The package also includes several univariate and multivariate spatial and spatio-temporal Bayesian models for high-dimensional areal count data based on the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) estimation technique.

See [https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/bigDM](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/bigDM) for details about installation and access to the vignettes accompanying this package.

# Lung cancer mortality data

We illustrate our proposed methodology by projecting lung cancer mortality data in the 7907 municipalities of continental Spain by considering 3-year ahead predictions using the period 1991-2012 as reference.

For that purpose we use the `Data_LungCancer` object available at the bigDM package, which contains simulated data of male lung cancer mortality counts (modified in order to preserve the confidentiality of the original data).

Specifically, the data set contains the following variables:
- ```ID```: character vector of geographic identifiers
- ```year```: numeric vector of yearâ€™s identifiers
- ```obs```: observed number of cases
- ```exp```: expected number of cases
- ```SMR```:  standardized mortality ratios
- ```pop```: population at risk

Use the following commands to load the data
```r 
> library(bigDM)
> data("Data_LungCancer")

> head(Data_LungCancer)
     ID year obs        exp      SMR     pop

# R code

This section includes the R scripts to fit with [R-INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/) the spatio-temporal projection models described in the present paper.

- [**Fit_model_projection.R**](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Scalable_Prediction/blob/main/R/Fit_model_projection.R)

  R code to fit the *classical* and *partition* models described in Orozco-Acosta et al. (2023) using the [bigDM](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/bigDM) package.

- [**Figures_and_Tables.R**](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Scalable_Prediction/blob/main/R/Figures_and_Tables.R)

  R code that contains the necessary functions to replicate most of the figures and tables of the present paper. Note that slightly different results are obtained since we are using simulated counts to preserve the confidentiality of the original data. The final model (1st-order neighbourhood + Type IV interaction) fitted using INLA can be downloaded from [https://emi-sstcdapp.unavarra.es/bigDM/k1_typeIV_simulated.Rdata](https://emi-sstcdapp.unavarra.es/bigDM/k1_typeIV_simulated.Rdata).

- [**CV_measures.R**](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/Scalable_Prediction/blob/main/R/CV_measures.R)

  R code to compute the logarithmic score (sum of the log-predictive densities computed over each area-time point) using both leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and leave-group-out cross validation (LGOCV) techniques in a small example. See [Liu, Z., and Rue, H. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04482.pdf) for further details.
